## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Functional Programming Style)

#### Repository Layer
- `TeacherRepository` - Teacher data operations
- `CourseRepository` - Course data operations with teacher support

#### Service Layer
- `TeacherService` - Teacher business logic
- `CourseService` - Course business logic with teacher operations

#### Controller Layer
- `TeacherController` - Teacher HTTP handlers
- `CourseController` - Course HTTP handlers with teacher authentication

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Teachers table
CREATE TABLE teachers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Updated courses table
CREATE TABLE courses (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  instructor TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  teacher_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers (id)
);
```

### Frontend (Vue 3 + TypeScript)

#### Components
- `TeacherLogin.vue` - Login form
- `TeacherRegister.vue` - Registration form
- `TeacherDashboard.vue` - Main dashboard
- `CourseModal.vue` - Course creation/editing modal

#### Services
- `teacherApi` - Teacher API calls
- `courseApi` - Course API calls with teacher support

#### Authentication
- Local storage-based session management
- Automatic teacher ID injection in API requests
- Route guards for protected pages
